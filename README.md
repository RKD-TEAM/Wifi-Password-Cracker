# Wifi Password Cracker Tool (Brute Force) â€” README

> **Important:** This repository is provided for educational, research, and defensive-security purposes only. Do **NOT** use this tool to access systems, accounts, or data that you do not own or do not have explicit authorization to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

## Overview

** Wifi Password Cracker Tool (Brute Force)** is a research/learning project that demonstrates concepts related to password strength, brute-force attack surface, and defensive security testing. The project is intended to help security students, defenders, and system administrators understand how weak credentials are vulnerable and how to better defend systems.

This repository **does not** provide or promote malicious activity. If you use the code, you must do so only:
- On systems you own, or
- In a controlled lab environment, or
- With explicit written permission from the system owner (e.g., an authorized penetration test engagement).

---

## Goals

- Provide an educational example of how password strength affects security.
- Offer a safe environment for learning about defensive countermeasures.
- Encourage best practices for secure password policies and rate-limiting.
- Demonstrate logging, test harnesses, and safe configuration for lab use.

---

## Features (Educational / Non-actionable)

- Example modules showing password-handling workflows (for educational purposes).
- Test harness to evaluate password policy strength against simulated inputs.
- Logging and reporting examples to show how to capture metrics in a controlled test.
- Guidelines and templates for running authorized security assessments.

> **Note:** The repository intentionally omits any automated instructions, scripts, or configurations for attacking real systems. It focuses on defensive insights, measurement, and education.
